Taiwo follow all this process carefully, when I was typing this I havent designed the admin panel, so
i might send it to you later.

Use <span></span> to select any item you want to program.

I will explain page by page.

Note: aside form emails any string document you will be typing that will display to d users ensure that the first letter is capitalized

New Pages:



There are some special users(all have an account already) that can be added to the admin table by the admin.
For every 5 people that Gh(Recieves money) I want you to make sure that the users on this table recieves 1. 
I.e distibute 4 people to the general users who are to recieve payment on the website, then give 1 to 1 of those 
users whose name and phone number are on the admin table.again distribute 4 to the general users, then 1 to anoda person on the table etc.
The maximum number of gh this speciqal users can recieve should be set to 4 as default pls do so. But the admin can alter the maximum anytime.
But pls ensure that every 12:00am that gh limit is set back to 4  maximum(default) 
   

	


1. AdminPanel

a. All users will create a normal account. So there are some special people we want to make room for.

	When the admin types in the details, I want you  to use that input form to collect the datas of
	those people through the phone number and add it to the table (Those Users must have been registered normally on the create account page)
Also use gh value to indicate the amount of payment special users have recieved daily. i.e if the special user clicks paid, Increment is gh value by 1

2. Adminpanel1

a. Login, 
	When the admin clicks on any users phone number in adminpanel.html, it will link d admin to adminpanel1.html.
	so if the admin clicks login I want u to allow the admin to access the users dashboard with passowrd or any other detail.
	(Allow the admin to access the dashboard of the phone number he clicked.)

	Note: ensure that no phone number can be use to open 2 accounts.


3. delete
	when the admin clics delete, I want you to delete the user from that table

For changing maximum number of paring for each special user daily.

with the new details.

5. gh/ghc/ghcc page

a. After registeration i want you to pair the user automatically to whom he is going to pay to, I want you to make sure that the user can never
be paired to the person that refered him/her to the platform.

b. I want you to hide the unpaid button

c. After paring I want a count down to begin from 6 hours downwards, after 6 hours is complete i want you to make the unpaid button visible.

Note: Only a maximum of two people can be paired to all user.(There are some that can recieve more than 2 dey are special, i will explain later)

d. once a person registers i want the program to pair an existing user to the person that newly registered, and I want all the details of the existing user 
to be sent to the "gh" page of the new user.

Note: all users can be paired to only the number people dey refered using their link or phone number. that is if i bring 1 person
 i can only be paired to one person, if i bring 2 i can only be paired to 2 etc. and nobody should pay to the person that referred them. 

e. please ensure that after after paring the first user, 6 other people have to be paired before that user can get 
   a second paring. that is after recieving ur first pair, 6 other people must be paired then you will recieve your second
   (the number of people you bring will determine the number of people that you will be paired to). 

f.once the paid( followed by "yes" in the next page) button is 
clicked ensure that the the person who paid the money should be in queue for payment and payment status should change to paid.

g. if the unpaid button(followed by no in the next page) is clicked, do not delete, only deactivate the user that did not pay. that means block the persons account and pair a new person to the
person that is to recieve payment. please ensure you replace the old persons details with the details of the new person that is paired.
immedately that person clicks unpaid, before a new person is paired, change the Current status in the table to "blocked" .
